Archie is a tool for indexing FTP archives, allowing users to more easily identify specific files. It is considered the first Internet search engine.[2] The original implementation was written in 1990 by Alan Emtage, then a postgraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.[3][4][5][6] Archie was superseded by other, more sophisticated search engines, including Jughead and Veronica, which were search engines for the Gopher protocol. These were in turn superseded by search engines like Yahoo! in 1995 and Google in 1998. Work on Archie ceased in the late 1990s. A legacy Archie server was maintained for historic purposes in Poland at University of Warsaw's Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling until 2023. Very few Archie server files, the files in this repository, still exist due to it originally costing $15,000 for these files to run a server. You can use the files provided to run one yourself if you are so inclined.
